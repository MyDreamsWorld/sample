Subject: Request for Compressed Day Adjustment

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope you're well. I wanted to ask if it's possible to switch my compressed day off from November 8 to November 1, and instead take a half-day compressed leave on November 8. This change is due to a medical appointment for my children.

Thank you so much for your understanding.

Best regards,
