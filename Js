Thank you very much for inviting me to the exam. I am genuinely interested in this opportunity and excited about the possibility of working with ATSS. I am confident that I can perform well in this role.

However, I have a pre-scheduled medical appointment at the hospital on the day of the exam at 9:30 AM. Unfortunately, rescheduling it would result in a significant delay. I can provide proof if required.

I am available to take the exam later in the afternoon on the same day, or on any other day that suits you.

I hope it will be possible to arrange an alternative exam date. Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
