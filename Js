Thank you for considering me for the IT-02 position within your team at CSC. I apologize for my delayed response as I was on vacation the past two days.

I am currently exploring opportunities and am very excited about the possibility of joining your team. I would be delighted to discuss the role in detail and explore how we can benefit mutually from this collaboration.

Wednesdays, particularly in the morning, are typically best for me for meetings; however, I am flexible and can adjust to other days if that better suits your schedule.

Regarding my background, I have extensive experience in quality assurance, quality control, and software testing, along with user experience/user interface design. These skills could add significant value to the project, especially if integrated from the onset as core elements of application development. I am keen to understand if I can apply these skills from the beginning of the project.

Please let me know a suitable time for our discussion. I look forward to contributing to and growing with CSC.

Best regards,
