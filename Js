I was wondering if our department conducts software testing that includes WCAG 2.1 or UX in general. Is this within the scope of our department's responsibilities? I'm asking because I haven't noticed this as part of the usual testing requirements here. Could it be because the application I am testing does not have a visual interface? Additionally, I would like to know if our quality assurance testing takes into consideration potential users with disabilities for any application we approve, whether they are internal employees or external users.
