Thank you for your encouraging response regarding our initiative—it’s great to hear that it has sparked your interest. Your willingness to provide feedback and suggestions is immensely appreciated and exactly the kind of collaborative effort we’re hoping for in our meeting.

I will touch base with the rest of the invited participants to discuss the proposed times and will get back to you by tomorrow with a confirmation of the meeting schedule that accommodates everyone’s availability.
