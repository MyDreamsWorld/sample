Thank you for moving my application to the next stage of the selection process. I am eager to participate in the written assessment and further demonstrate my qualifications.

I am available to complete the assessment on Monday, July 8th at 10:00 pm PT. 

Thank you for this opportunity. I look forward to the next steps.

Best regards,


I wanted to inform you that I need to drive my daughter to an important appointment, which may take up to half an hour. Due to this commitment, I may not be able to attend today's meetings, but I will keep my status updated on TEAMS.

Yesterday, I met with John to discuss the next steps for Project X. He provided me with the current mockups, which I have been reviewing. Today, I am examining the project backlog on Azure, focusing on the Epics and features listed there. So far, I have not encountered any obstacles.
