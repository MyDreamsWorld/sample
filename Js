Good morning Kareem,

Thank you for your guidance regarding the updates to my timesheet entries.

I have consistently used the activity code "888" for all previous weeks as instructed. For the current week, I am awaiting approval for my compressed week request to accurately complete the timesheet based on the correct working hours.

I appreciate your efforts in resolving the issues with my CAS profile and look forward to any updates.

Please let me know if you need anything further from me.

Best regards,
