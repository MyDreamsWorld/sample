Hi  ,

Thank you for your detailed questions regarding the Aaa project release 3333 testing approach. I appreciate the opportunity to clarify our plans and ensure we're aligned.

To address your queries:

Testing Environments: We require both RTL1 and RTL2 for testing because RTL1 will be linked to the On-Prem data, while RTL2 will connect to the newly migrated data in Azure Cloud. This setup allows us to compare results and outputs across both environments effectively.
Testing Duration: Initially, three days were allocated for testing each environment (totaling six days) due to changes in the Aaa application interfaces and the need to adapt our testing to these updates. However, based on current readiness, we now anticipate that two days per environment (totaling four days) will suffice.
Smoke Testing: The inclusion of Smoke Testing before new code implementation is intended to ensure that each environment operates correctly before we proceed with regression testing. While this step is not mandatory, it is a good preliminary check. We can do it on the same day as the other tests without extending the total testing days.
Placement of Smoke Testing in the Plan: I recognize that listing Smoke Testing under data requirements may not be the most appropriate. However, it did not seem to fit neatly into other sections of the testing plan.
I hope this response clarifies the rationale behind our testing strategy. Thank you again for your support. I apologize for any confusion and am here to assist with further questions.

Best regards,

Thank you,
