Thank you for the start date options. Given the importance of ensuring a thorough knowledge transfer to my current team, I would prefer to begin on April 30th. This timing will facilitate a smoother transition.

Additionally, I am checking if I  understand these two points clearly: firstly, that my leave is approved from December 10, 2025, for two months; and secondly, that my employment will commence immediately on a permanent basis without a probationary period.

Thank you for your support and understanding. I eagerly await your confirmation.
