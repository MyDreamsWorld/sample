Issue 1: Unauthorized Access to Clickable File Link
Description:
Even though the user is not logged in, the file link appears to be clickable. When the user attempts to click on the link, the application does not respond. However, a small box appears in the bottom-left corner of the screen, indicating a UI glitch or underlying issue.

Expected Behavior:
The file link should be disabled for users who are not logged in, preventing any interaction. The application should provide appropriate feedback, such as a tooltip or disabled cursor, to indicate that the link is not accessible without authentication.

Steps to Reproduce:

Open the application without logging in.
Locate the file link on the interface.
Attempt to click on the file link.
Observe the UI behavior (box appearing) without any response.
Issue 2: Redirecting to Unintended XML File on Session Expiry
Description:
If a logged-in user’s session expires, clicking on the same clickable file link redirects the user to a different page containing an XML file. This behavior is unintended, as the user should not be able to access any files without an active session.

Expected Behavior:
When the user’s session expires, the file link should either be disabled or redirect the user to a login page instead of displaying an XML file. Proper session management and error handling should be implemented to prevent unauthorized access.

Steps to Reproduce:

Log in to the application.
Let the session expire naturally or terminate it manually.
Attempt to click on the file link again.
Observe the redirection to an unintended XML file page.
Let me know if you need any adjustments or additional points for these descriptions.
