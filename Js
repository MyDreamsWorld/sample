It is truly an honor for me to join this meeting to discuss some thoughts and ideas that have come to mind while working on various projects. I am very much looking forward to meeting you all.

I had been planning to reach out to you, but I wished for more time to articulate my ideas more thoroughly. However, there might be a benefit in presenting them in a condensed manner, as it could potentially sharpen my focus on a specific concept, which also has its advantages.

I am grateful to you all for providing me with this opportunity.
