I hope you are doing well.

I must bring to your attention that, due to an oversight, the presentation draft you received was not the correct one. This unfortunately means that the edits you made were applied to a concept not finalized by our team. We sincerely apologize for this unintended mix-up.

Would you need additional time to review the correct presentation and its initial concept? If so, we may need to reschedule our meeting to accommodate this change. Alternatively, if you feel comfortable, we can proceed with our scheduled meeting and address any further details subsequently.

Your understanding is greatly appreciated, and we apologize for any inconvenience caused.

Please let us know your preference at your earliest convenience.

Best regards,
