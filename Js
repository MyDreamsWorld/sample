Thank you for your attention to this matter. As I previously mentioned, I recommend Mariam's candidacy for our team based on a few reasons:

Currently employed in the Commercial Applications department as a programmer, with testing being an integral part of her role.
Mariam has excelled in creating documentation for her team, conducting it so proficiently that the department director has asked her to lead an initiative to standardize this practice across the department.
Having studied with her in college for a year, I can attest to her outstanding personality, performance, and approachability. She was exceptional in her interactions and sharing knowledge with her peers.
I believe that Mariam would be an excellent addition to our team.

Thank you.
