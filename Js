As you mentioned, the first item is not a real problem or a showstopper. However, just in case, we may need to wait a few hours to confirm whether we are dealing with a real bug when a similar situation arises, as it did last Friday.

And yes, the second issue is indeed not a problem at all.

I appreciate your attention to these matters.
