Notes for User Story
The page is not ready for testing yet; it is still under modification.
I am currently unable to access the login page by clicking on the green button.
The multi-factor authentication feature is not working at the moment.
I need a test account with GCKey and a test account with one or more Partners to fully test the feature.
I am currently unable to test how the system handles a user with an existing account. It is not clear which page this user will be directed to, and I cannot test this scenario at the moment.
