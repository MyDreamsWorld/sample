I hope this message finds you well.

I wanted to bring to your attention that the timesheets for May and June 2024 have not yet been approved. It appears there was an issue within the ESS system during those months, preventing the timesheets from reaching the managerâ€™s universal worklist for approval.

Based on my previous experiences with ESS, re-releasing the timesheets for these months should resolve the issue. I am confident that you will then find my timesheets for May and June 2024 in your universal worklist.

Additionally, I have learned that this issue might be affecting other divisions as well. If we confirm this, I am more than willing to offer my assistance to any team members experiencing similar difficulties.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,
