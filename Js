I regret to inform you that I've been hit with a severe bout of illness, with symptoms starting yesterday. Despite my efforts to push through and complete my tasks yesterday, the condition has significantly worsened today. Unfortunately, I find myself in need of taking a sick leave for the day.

Yesterday, we made several attempts to complete the program testing, but we have yet to achieve satisfactory results. Although I am currently unable to access the AOQ, a colleague has been assisting by copying the necessary files to an alternate location for my access.

I had planned to attempt a different testing method today using an external device, and Sa'eed is briefed on the details.

I apologize for any inconvenience my absence may cause and thank you for your understanding. I will keep you updated on my recovery and return.
