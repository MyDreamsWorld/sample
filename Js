Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. Please find below key points regarding the attached schedules and testing estimations:

Estimates Provided: The tables attached contain an estimated number of test cases, which may vary as more information becomes available.
Time Estimates: The time shown in the schedules covers only the execution of test cases. It does not include the time needed for manually or automatically writing, building, reviewing, or verifying these cases.
Subsequent Testing Phases:
Following the initial execution, regression tests and some additional test cases will be developed.
The next step will involve transitioning these into automated tests as a secondary phase.
Development Stage Involvement: Most of the effort required for building both manual and automated tests will be coordinated during the development stage.
Thank you for reviewing these points. Please let me know if you require further details or clarification on any aspect.
