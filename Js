Dear [Manager’s Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to seek your approval to attend an upcoming training session on DevOps in the Government of Canada. This training is scheduled to be held in-person and is directly relevant to our current projects and future initiatives.

The training aims to enhance our understanding and application of DevOps practices tailored specifically to government operations. I believe that participating in this session will not only benefit our ongoing projects but also equip our team with advanced skills and insights that could improve our operational efficiency and project outcomes.

Please let me know if you require any further details regarding the training or if there are any concerns about my attendance. I am keen on ensuring this opportunity aligns with our department's objectives and your expectations.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your approval.

Best regards,

I anticipate that I will be back at work before noon and will ensure that any pending tasks are addressed promptly upon my return. Please let me know if there's anything specific you would like me to prioritize or prepare beforehand.

Thank you for your understanding.

Dear Tom and John,

I hope this message finds you well. I would like to discuss a potential adjustment to my schedule for the next two Fridays due to a key workshop, XYZ, that I believe is important for my current projects.

This week, I have a full day off scheduled for Friday. Next week, I am slated to work a half-day. Considering the importance of the XYZ workshop occurring this Friday, I propose to switch my schedules between these two weeks. My suggestion is to work a half-day this Friday in the afternoon, allowing me to attend the workshop. Consequently, I would then take my full day off next Friday.

Please let me know if this adjustment works for you or if there are any concerns or conflicts with this plan.

Thank you for considering my request. I believe this adjustment will ensure that I am able to contribute effectively to the workshop while aligning with our team's goals.

Best regards,
