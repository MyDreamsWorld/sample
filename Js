Thank you for your update regarding the start date. While I am genuinely excited about joining the team, I need to bring to your attention a few points that may impact the suggested start date.

1. I have a pre-approved necessary vacation starting December 6th for two months, with travel arrangements already made for my family.

2. As discussed, I am currently enrolled in a full-time program that concludes in early December. This is crucial for enhancing my role-related skills in Azure, AWS, and DevOps.

3. I am also scheduled to complete the ISTQB Foundation Level Exam in early December, funded by my current management, which requires good preparation.

Given these commitments, I believe a more suitable start date would be early February upon my return. This timing would allow me to join your team fully prepared and contribute effectively.

Additionally, could you please clarify:
- Is there a probationary period, or will the position immediately offer a permanent contract, considering my previous government role?
- What level and grade have been assigned to me in the contract?
- Does the position require daily physical presence, or is there flexibility for remote work days?
- Does your organization support a compressed workweek schedule?

Thank you for considering my circumstances. I look forward to potentially starting at a time that maximizes our mutual benefits.

Best regards,
