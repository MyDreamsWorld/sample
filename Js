Hello,

Thank you for your communication last Friday informing me of my placement in the pool of partially qualified candidates for the IT Analyst, Software Solutions (Cloud Services Application: Services) positions. I am pleased to hear this news and appreciate the transparency and effort invested in this selection process.

I have a few questions regarding the term "partially qualified" and its implications for my candidacy. Could you please clarify what this designation entails, especially since the Official Language Proficiency criterion has not been assessed yet? I am currently working at the same group and level, and I have also completed a diploma in Canadaâ€”could these factors be considered to enhance my qualifications?

Additionally, I would like to know whether my candidacy is being considered for indeterminate or term positions, as I am unfamiliar with this aspect of the process.

Thank you once again for your time and attention. I look forward to your guidance and any further steps I might take to expedite my selection.

Have a great day!

Best regards,
