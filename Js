I hope this email finds you well.

I am writing to inform you that, following a recent request and subsequent approval from our manager, I have adjusted my work schedule to a compressed week format. This adjustment allows me to take a full day off every other Friday, with a half-day schedule (ending at 12:00 PM) on the alternate Fridays. To accommodate this schedule, I will be working additional hours during the remaining days of the week to ensure full coverage and maintain productivity.

This schedule was approved by our manager yesterday, and I wanted to ensure you were informed. I am committed to managing my tasks efficiently and being available during working hours.

Thank you very much for your understanding and support in this matter.

Submission of Conversation Screenshots with Sami

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope this email finds you well.

I remembered your request just in time, as conversations on our chat program are set to disappear after a certain period. I wanted to ensure you had access to this information as needed.

As per your request, I am sending you screenshots of my recent conversation with Sami for your reference. ( only for your reference please and does not require any action on your part, for myself, I will give him another opportunity ) .

Wishing you a pleasant day ahead. Thank you for your understanding and continued support.

Best regards,
