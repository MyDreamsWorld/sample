I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to discuss my availability for the upcoming scheduling period. I am available for most of the proposed times. However, there will be a scheduling conflict between December 9th and December 18th. Please rest assured, I will complete the User Acceptance Testing after Sprint 14 before proceeding on my leave.

I have detailed my availability in the attached schedule for your reference.

Please note, I will be on vacation from December 9th to January 19th. Thank you for your understanding and accommodation of this schedule.

Best regards,
