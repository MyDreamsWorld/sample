Following up on my previous email, I spoke with Tom this morning. He clarified the two issues in his email:

The first issue involved an unexplained delay in Application 2 during the processing of the request (as we expected in the previous email).

The second point noted that the request was rejected, which was the expected outcome for this particular test case.

Additionally, Ahmed recently informed me that Application 2 might experience unexplained delays in processing and sending requests to Application 1 on Friday afternoons to evenings. This could potentially explain the behavior observed during last Friday's testing.

I hope this clarifies the reason behind the issue we encountered.
