I recently completed testing for ticket \[insert ticket number] and would like to share a few UI observations I noticed. While they may be outside the ticket's current scope, I believe they’re worth considering for future improvements:

1. On the English version of the form, the horizontal scrollbar remains visible even when the page is expanded—unlike the French version, where this does not occur.
2. Some elements are misaligned compared to their neighboring items.
3. Certain bullet points appear in bold font on the French form but are in regular font on the English one.
4. The triangle bullets preceding some items vary in size across different points and also between the two language versions.
5. Checkboxes are used instead of radio buttons, which may confuse users by suggesting multiple selections are allowed. Notably, the English version of Attachment 1 (from the user story) uses checkboxes, while the French version uses radio buttons.
