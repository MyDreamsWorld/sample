Request for Remote Work on Thursdays

I wanted to discuss a scheduling challenge I am facing regarding my ability to come to the office on Thursdays for the next three months. My child attends Forest School, and my wife used to handle drop-offs and pick-ups on Thursdays. However, she recently started a new job, which makes Thursdays particularly challenging for me.

Would it be possible for me to work remotely on Thursdays during this period? I would greatly appreciate your consideration.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
