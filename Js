Thank you for sending over the employment contract. I’m thrilled to receive it and will carefully review the documents, returning them signed within the next few days.

I’d also like to kindly remind you of my pre-approved leave starting from December 6th for two months. While my current manager has approved it and it's on my calendar, I haven’t yet confirmed if it's been officially entered into our system.

Thank you for your understanding, and I appreciate your continued support.
