 Subject: Arrival at Office

Dear [Manager's Name],

I started my workday at 8:00 a.m. from home. as usual. I plan to go into the office between 9:00 and 10:00 a.m., as I currently donâ€™t have a designated cubicle to sit in. By that time, I believe most of the team there.

Additionally, I submitted a ticket requesting a headset with a microphone, but I was informed that this request should be directed to my manager rather than the IT department. May I request your assistance in obtaining this equipment?

Thank you very much for your understanding and support

Best regards,
[Your Name]
