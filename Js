Sick Leave Notification

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to inform you that I will need to take a sick leave today. Unfortunately, I am not feeling well, having experienced difficulty breathing and a lack of sleep last night. Given my condition, I believe it is best for me to rest and recover properly.

While I am out, I will periodically check our team's chat program to see if Tom has any questions or if there are urgent matters that require my attention. Additionally, if there is a need for my involvement this Friday to complete the testing, please know that I am prepared to assist.

Thank you for your understanding, and I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. I will keep you updated on my status.

Subject: Update on User Stories and Meeting Availability for Friday

Dear John,

I hope this message finds you well.

Regrettably, I need to inform you that I will not be available this Friday and will be unable to attend the scheduled meeting. I wanted to provide a brief update on the status of the three user stories we have been encountering challenges with:

1. **User Story 1** is currently tested through a temporary method using a Google account, which you are aware of. Consequently, it has been moved to the blocked list due to its dependency issues.
   
2. **User Story 2** is not retaining new data entries and is displaying data from a different user. This issue is accompanied by several other minor bugs that need attention.
   
3. **User Story 3** similarly fails to retain new data inputs and shows data from another user, along with other technical concerns.

For detailed information, you can refer to the links for each user story below:
- Link 1
- Link 2
- Link 3

I apologize for any inconvenience my absence may cause and thank you for your understanding. I wish you a pleasant weekend and look forward to catching up with you and the team on Tuesday.

Best regards,
