Verify that the dropdown contains a list of active appointment statuses (including any newly created custom active statuses and excluding inactive ones).
Select a specific active status from the dropdown (e.g., "Rescheduled - Confirmed").
Proceed with the batch reschedule operation. Expected Results:

Verify the status of each moved appointment. c. Navigate to the original date/time (if appointments were moved, not copied) and verify the status of any remaining placeholders or original appointment entries (if applicable based on system behavior for "move"). Expected Results:
All appointments that were moved to the new date/time now display the status selected by the user during the batch reschedule process (e.g., "Rescheduled - Confirmed").
The original appointments on the old date (if moved, not copied) should reflect this change or be marked appropriately (e.g., with the selected status, or a system status like "Moved"). The requirement implies the moved appointments get the new status. Actual Results: Status: Notes/Remarks: Clarify behavior of original appointment slots after a "move".
5. Reporting
Test Case ID: TC_Report_Daysheet_001
Test Case Title: Verify Daysheet report accurately reflects appointments with new, existing, and inactive statuses.

One appointment with an inactive status has been updated to a new active status (as per Scenario 3). Test Steps:
Run the Daysheet report for the relevant date(s) covering the appointments mentioned in preconditions.
Examine the report for the appointment with the newly created active status. Verify its status is displayed correctly.
Examine the report for the appointment with the existing system status. Verify its status is displayed correctly.
Examine the report for an appointment that still has an assigned inactive status. Verify its status is displayed correctly (and an icon might be present as per AC3).
