Thank you for your feedback.

I have revised the test plan to incorporate this update and have attached the updated document for your review. Please take a look at the adjustments made under the Environmental Needs section.

If there are any further modifications or recommendations that you think should be considered for the plan, please let me know. 

Thanks,
