Thank you for the update regarding my status in the selection process for the IT Analyst, Stream 1 position. I am pleased to hear that I have been placed in the pool of partially qualified candidates. I truly appreciate the effort and transparency throughout this process.

Additionally, I would like to inquire whether my name has been added to the list for Indeterminate positions, as this aspect of the process is new to me. 

Thank you once again for your time and attention to this matter.
