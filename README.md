I was wondering which of the workshops you participated in during the  exhibition held about two weeks ago stood out to you the most and why. Your insights on what made this particular workshop more appealing to you than the others would be greatly appreciated. Alternatively, if you prefer, feel free to talk about any other workshop you've taken outside of this exhibition that left a significant impression on you.
