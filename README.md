Welcome aboard! We are thrilled to have you join our team. Please know that we are always here to answer any questions you might have. Your curiosity and inquiries are welcome, so never hesitate to reach out if you need clarity on anything.

Samira has kindly arranged a meeting for us tomorrow. It will be you, me, Jody (who is currently leading our team), and myself for an introductory session about our department. However, please feel free to get in touch with any of us at any time before or after the meeting; there will be no awkwardness on our part.

Once again, welcome to the team! We look forward to working with you and seeing the great things we will accomplish together.

Best regards,
