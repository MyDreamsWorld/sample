### Comprehensive POTO Floating Button Test Suite: RRRR (RRRR) Workflow  
Objective: Validate the POTO Floating Button for functionality, edge cases, and usability.  

---

### Test Case Design Principles  
1. Visibility: Ensure the POTO text remains visible during form completion.  
2. Sticky Display: Validate the button remains sticky at the top or floating on the right.  
3. Content Accuracy: Verify POTO text matches specifications.  
4. Edge Cases: Test extreme scenarios (e.g., long text, concurrent edits).  
5. Localization: Validate bilingual support for POTO text.

1. Enter 10,000 characters of POTO text.  
2. Click the POTO Floating Button.  
3. Scroll through the form.  
Expected Results:  
- POTO text is displayed without truncation or overlap.  
- Text remains readable and scrollable.  

---

Test Case 8: TC-POTO-E02 – Concurrent POTO Updates  
Objective: Validate behavior when two users update POTO text simultaneously.  
Priority: Medium  
Steps:  
1. User A opens an RRRR form and updates POTO text.  
2. User B opens the same form and updates POTO text.  
3. User A clicks the POTO Floating Button.  
Expected Results:  
- User A sees the updated POTO text.  

---

#### 5. Localization  

---

Test Case 9: TC-POTO-L01 – Bilingual POTO Text  
Objective: Validate POTO text in English and French.  
Priority: High  
Steps:  
1. Switch the system language to French.  
2. Open an RRRR form.  
3. Click the POTO Floating Button.  
Expected Results:  
- POTO text is accurately translated into French.  

---

Test Case 10: TC-POTO-L02 – Bilingual Error Messages  
Objective: Validate error messages in English and French.  
Priority: Medium  
Steps:  
1. Simulate an error (e.g., missing POTO text).  
2. Check the error message in both languages.  
Expected Results:  
- Error message displays in English and French:  
  - English: "POTO text is missing."  
  - French: "Le texte du POTOe est manquant."

### Notes for Execution  
- Edge Case Coverage:  
  - Test zero-length POTO text.  
  - Validate timezone handling for printed timestamps.  
- Performance Testing:  
  - Load test with 100+ concurrent users.  
  - Monitor API response times during POTO updates.
