Problem Statement

#### Body:

The core problem our project addresses revolves around three critical issues faced by our company in the context of using external AI and machine learning services:

1. **Data Privacy and Security**: Our current reliance on external AI services exposes sensitive company data to potential privacy breaches and security risks. The transmission and storage of proprietary information on external servers present a significant vulnerability.

2. **Customization Limitations**: Off-the-shelf AI solutions often lack the flexibility to be tailored to our specific business needs. This one-size-fits-all approach can result in suboptimal performance and inefficiencies in addressing unique challenges within our operations.

3. **Ongoing Costs and Dependencies**: Subscription-based models for external AI services lead to recurring expenses that can accumulate significantly over time. Additionally, these dependencies on third-party providers limit our control over the tools and technologies that are becoming increasingly central to our business processes.

### Necessity of the Project:

This project is essential for several reasons:

- **Enhancing Data Sovereignty**: Developing an in-house GPT model will allow us to retain full control over our data, ensuring that sensitive information remains within our secure, internal network.
